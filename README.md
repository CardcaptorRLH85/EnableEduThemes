# EnableEduThemes

This registry file enables the otherwise hidden educational themes in Windows 11 22H2.

I've compiled the instructions located in [this Lifehacker article](https://lifehacker.com/your-windows-pc-has-hidden-themes-1849911491) into a single registry file.
**Check the file before running it!  Don't trust random registry files from the internet!**
I'm not trying to break your computer but some people might.
